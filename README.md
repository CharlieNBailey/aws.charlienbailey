# aws.charlienbailey

Stored in this repo will be all of the html, css and any other code used on my website charlienbailey.click

The aim of the site is for it to be a summary of my professional career, with a focus on my cloud projects, certifications and contribution to the cloud community. There will also be a copy of my current CV on the site.

The main web address will lead to a landing page, containing links to several of my personal accounts ranging from LinkedIn to GitHub. I will install my hit counter to register how many visits have been made to the site.
